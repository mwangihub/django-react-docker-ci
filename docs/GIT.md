# Git commands.
___
### <u>Creating new branch.</u>
```bash
git branch <branch_name>
# or
git checkout -b <branch name>
# Confirm the branch you're in
git branch
# Create branch from another branch.
git checkout -b <new_branch> <from_branch>
```
### <u>Merging two branches.</u>
```bash
# Use git checkout to switch to the branch you 
# want to merge into. i.e merge to main
git checkout main
# Next, use git merge and specify the name of 
# the other branch to bring into this branch
git merge production # (fast-forward merge)
# Work continues on the main and other 
# branches, so they no longer share a common
# commit history. Now a developer wants to merge the 
# featureX branch into the main branch.
git merge featureX # (three-way (or recursive) merge)
```
### <u>Merging Branches to Remote Repository.</u>
If you create a branch in your local repository,the 
remote repository is not aware of the branchâ€™s existence. 
Before you can push the branch code in the remote repository, 
you set the remote repository as the upstream branch using 
the ``git push`` command.
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin <the_new_branch>
# Probably the main branch is already merged with other branches
# Use
git merge main
```
### <u>Pull requests.</u>
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've 
pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. 
Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the 
potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits 
before your changes are merged into the base branch.
